## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This application leverages the power of modern web technologies to run entirely on the client-side, fetching all dependencies from a CDN.

-   **HTML5 & CSS3**: The core structure and styling.
-   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: For a utility-first CSS framework to build the modern UI.
-   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: For building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
-   **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)**: The powerhouse behind the data-driven, interactive tree visualization.
-   **[fast-xml-parser](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser)**: For robust and high-performance XML parsing in the browser.
-   **[Babel Standalone](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone)**: Transpiles JSX and modern JavaScript on-the-fly, directly in the browser, eliminating the need for any build process.

### Why a Single HTML File?

This project is intentionally bundled into a single file to maximize portability and ease of use. This approach is perfect for:
-   **Local Tools**: Keep it on your desktop as a handy utility.
-   **Easy Sharing**: Send the single `index.html` file to anyone, and it will just work.
-   **Simple Demos**: Showcase the power of modern web libraries without any complex setup.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Development & Modification

While the app is a single file, the code is well-structured within the `<script type="text/babel">` tag inside `index.html`. You can edit the React components directly in the HTML file. The code is organized to mirror a standard React project structure, with sections for icons, components (`XmlEditor`, `Header`, `TreeView`), and the main `App` component.

To make changes:
1.  Open `index.html` in a code editor.
2.  Locate the `<script type="text/babel" data-type="module">` tag.
3.  Modify the React/JavaScript code inside.
4.  Save the file and refresh your browser to see the changes.
